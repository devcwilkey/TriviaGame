# TriviaGame
For our Full Stack Web Developer class we had a requirement to build a Trivia Game using javascript and timers.  To help create a bit more of a challenge I developed the game with multiple difficulties to contorl game speed and utilized multiple subjects "Disney", "Survival", and "Useless" trivia.


## Website:
[TriviaGame - Game](https://devcwilkey.github.io/TriviaGame/)

### How-To Play:
Under the website links (above) click the Game link.
1. When loaded, set a "Difficulty".
   - Hover over options to see specfic settings.
2. Select a Trivia Category.
3. Once the Game Begins, a Question is displayed with a Timer at the Bottom.
   - Select an answer before time runs out.
4. Once you have selected an Answer or Time Runs Out the correct answer is displayed and the scored is updated.
5. At the end of the game a Final Score is displayed for the round.
6. The Trivia Game will start again using the same settings from last round unless you choose a new Difficulty or Topic.


### Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- Javascript


### Things to Change or Fix
- Adjust the Question Timer so it is larger and more visible.
- If an Answer is not selected in Time; display a message as the user can click an answer just as the clock expires.
- Add theming per Topic.
